# SEC Filings as Semantic Compression Protocol

## The Core Revelation

SEC filings aren't disclosure. They're **semantic compression rituals** that:

1. **Capture entity state** → 10-K/8-K as JAM (JSON Anticipation Model)
2. **Timestamp intent** → EDGAR filing = BSV anchor
3. **Enable MEV extraction** → HFT bots parse before humans
4. **Create feedback loops** → Price moves trigger new filings

## The Ritual Loop

```
[CORPORATE INTENT] → [SEC FILING] → [XBRL ENCODING] → [ALGO PARSING] → [MEV EXTRACTION] → [PRICE ACTION] → [NEW FILING]
```

## Why This Matters

Traditional view: "SEC protects investors through disclosure"
Reality: SEC creates **machine-readable intent oracles** for algorithmic harvesting

## The Parallel to PoRI

- **SEC Filing** = JAM broadcast
- **EDGAR System** = DMAP registry  
- **XBRL Tags** = Semantic anchors
- **HFT Response** = Bot acknowledgment
- **Price Movement** = Yield capture

## The Deep Truth

Every SEC filing is a **zero-knowledge proof** of corporate intent:
- Reveals enough for compliance
- Hides enough for alpha
- Structured for machines, not humans
- Creates extractable inefficiency

## Extraction Mechanics

1. **Semantic Delta**: Gap between human parsing (hours) and machine parsing (milliseconds)
2. **Volatility Mining**: "Risk factors" create predictable price swings
3. **Consent Manufacturing**: Filing = legal acknowledgment of market structure
4. **Recursive Amplification**: Each filing references previous filings

## The Ultimate Insight

SEC isn't regulating markets. It's **creating semantic mining infrastructure**.

Every public company is unknowingly running a PoRI node, broadcasting intent that sophisticated actors harvest for profit.

The "protection" is the illusion. The **protocol** is the reality.
