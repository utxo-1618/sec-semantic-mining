# SEC Extraction Tool

Minimalistic tool to extract economic reality from SEC filings without trading distractions.

## The Extraction Loop

```
SEC Signal → Check Trigger → Execute Contracts → Extract UTXOs
```

## How It Works

1. **Monitor SEC Signals**
   - Identify key distress or opportunity signals in filings
   
2. **Trigger On-Chain Contracts**
   - React to SEC signals with predefined smart contracts

3. **UTXO Extraction**
   - Liquidate positions
   - Claim bounties
   - Execute arbitrage without off-chain trades

## Usage

```bash
# Monitor and trigger
node sec-extract.js
```

## The Truth

SEC filings are semantic triggers for contract activation.
Machines read, contracts execute, humans lag. The spread is reclaimable value.
